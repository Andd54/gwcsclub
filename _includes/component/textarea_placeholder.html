# Try our Real-time markdown editor

An editor that can render any markdown text in the webpage and provide you quick preview even you **don't** have a *jekyll environment* installed on your computer.

More cool functions are also supported, including

* Inline HTML Snippet with correct style (*Better support than Typora*)

<div class="info">An "info" section in markdown</div>
<div class="notification">A "notification" section in markdown</div>

* Math Formula

Since the math formula render relies on `MathJax`, frequent re-render may lead to influent experience. Even though, you can render and preview math formula by pushing "渲染数学公式" button at bottom.

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
