## Problem 2. Barn Painting

### Problem Description

Farmer John has $N$ barns connected together. (**It is guaranteed that the connected graph does NOT contain a cycle**) and three different paints. He has already painted $K$ of $N$ barns. Find out the number of valid ways he can paint the remaining barns.

### Proposed Solution

We can solve this problem recursively. Let $f(n, c)$ represent the number of possible valid solutions of painting on a subtree with root $n$ and color $c$ on root, we can represent this function recursively.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&U = \left\{n' \mid n' \text{ is child of }n\right\}\\
&f(n, c) = \prod_{u\in U}\left({\sum_{c'\in C}{f(u, c')}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

When we meet a node that is already been painted, we let $f(node, c) = 0$ if $c$ is not the color that is painted.

### Time Complexity Analysis

For each node, we will calculate $f(n, c)$ for at most three times (with three different $c$). Therefore, the time complexity will be $O(3N)$.
