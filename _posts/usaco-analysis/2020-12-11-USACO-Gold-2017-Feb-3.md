## Problem 3. Why Did the Cow Cross the Road III

### Problem Description

The pasture of John's farm is circular and there are $2N$ points to get in / out of the pasture. Everyday, $N$ cows will go in and out from different door and every door is only used by one cow once (either in / out). Now, John have collected all the in & out doors of the cows. He wants to know the number pairs that will "cross over". 

> For instance, if a cow get in from $1$ and get out from $3$ while the other cow get in from $2$ and out of $4$, they will "cross over".

### Proposed Solution

We can use a [Binary Index Tree](https://markyutianchen.gitee.io/react-app-test/#/posts/BinaryIndexTree) here to solve the problem.

First, we will construct a Binary Index Tree with length $2N$ and initialized with 0. Then, we will loop on the possible in/out gates. When we have passed through one point, we should do these things:

1. Check if we have passed through a point that belongs to same breed before
   1. If yes, update the Binary Index tree to change both current index and the position of previous gate of same breed to 0. Calculate the sum of BIT in range $(\text{previous gate}, \text{current gate})$.
   2. If not, update the Binary Index tree to change value on current index from 0 to 1.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class USACO2017FebGold3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("circlecross.in"));
        PrintWriter pr = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("circlecross.out"));

        int N = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        int[] cowInfo = new int[2 * N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; i ++){ cowInfo[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()); }

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> positionRec = new HashMap<>();
        BIT rec = new BIT(new int[2 * N]);
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; i ++){
            int breed = cowInfo[i];
            if (positionRec.keySet().contains(breed)){
                rec.updatePoint(positionRec.get(breed), 0);
                result += rec.getSum(positionRec.get(breed), i);
            }
            else{
                positionRec.put(breed, i);
                rec.updatePoint(i, 1);
            }
        }

        pr.println(result);

        br.close();
        pr.close();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

Since the update and calculation of range sum on BIT only have a time complexity of $O(\log{n})$ , the over all time complexity will be $O(n\log{n})$.

Since $1\leq n \leq 50000$, this time complexity is acceptable.
