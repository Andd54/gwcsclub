## 14.1 Representing Knowledge in an Uncertain Domain

This section will introduce a data structure called **Bayesian network** to represent the dependencies between variables. Bayesian network can represent *any* full-joint probability distribution and in many cases can do so very concisely.

A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAC) where each node is annotated with quantitative probability information.

1. Each node corresponds to a random variable, which may be discrete or continuous.
2. A set of directed links or arrows connects pairs of nodes. If there is an arrow from node $X$ to $Y$, $X$ is said to be a parent of $Y$.
3. Each node $X_i$ has a conditional probability distribution $\mathbf{P}(X_i\mid Parents(X_i))$ that quantifies the effect of the parents on the node.

In each node of the Bayesian network, a conditional probability table (CPT) is stored. For instance, the node "$Toothache$" stores $\mathbf{P}(Toothache \mid Cavity)$.

In general, a table for a Boolean variable with $k$ Boolean parents contains $2^k$ independently specifiable probabilities.
