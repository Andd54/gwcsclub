<p>88518J, this alphanumerical sequence means a lot to us, last year, 88518J represented as a team from Guangzhou Foreign Language School, and had already been with us for two years. We are not simply going to treat this name as a name, we are going to treat this name as a spirit, an expectation.</p>

<h3 id="our-stories">Our stories</h3>

<p>Because of the specialty of our school, most of our VEX contestants can only compete for one year, which means, most of our VEX contestants can only get familiar with VEX robotic component within months, and get used to the feeling of operation. As a result, a significant difference between we and other contestants is we are not as sophisticated as others in operating the robot. However, these issues have overcome by us, through determination, and insistence. There is a quote that says an actual combat will do the same as swing the sword for ten thousand times. After our first mocking battle with other contestants, we found that our techniques of operating are way too worse than the other contestants. But after training, we are finally able to keep up the pace of the other competitors.</p>

<h3 id="about-us">About US</h3>

<p>There are 6 teammates in our team, and we are just as a family, whenever we have trouble, we will all gather up together and figure out the right solution to the problem.</p>
